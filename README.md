**INTRODUCTION**

The first Covid-19 case in Kenya identified on 13th March 2020, was a 27-year old woman who traveled from the USA via London. The Kenyan Government identified and isolated the number of people who had come into contact with the first case. On 15th March, Cabinet Secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe announced two people who had come into contact with the lady had also tested positive. Until February 2021, there were 5,200 new cases taking the total number of confirmed cases to 105,973. The death toll rose to 1856. The number of recovered patients increased to 86,678 leaving 17,439 active cases. 
The current Covid-19 is a rapidly evolving global challenge and like any pandemic, it weakens the immune system,costs lives and also poses a great risk to global economy and security. Covid-19 being a novel virus and as the outbreak evolves ,research is ongoing to better understand its dynamics of transmission and improve case management.The UN Economic Commision for Africa estimates Africa's growth will drop by 1.4%as a result of the coronavirus

**RESEARCH OBJECTIVE**
The overall objective is to analyze the surge of COVID-19 on Kenyaâ€™s population between March 2020 and February 2021.

**Specific Objectives**
- To analyze the male to female infection ratio
- To analyze the death ratio.
- To justify the  recent imposed lockdowns.
- To identify  the vaccination target areas
- To calculate the Infection rate and mortality rate

**RESULTS**

Using the cleaned data, it was possible for us to answer some of the questions related to the sex distribution, recovery to death ratio, infection, mortality and  recovery rates. We were also able to derive information that would justify the imposed lockdowns and also target the vaccination hotspots. We found the following insights during our analysis:
The ratio of male to female infections showed that for every male infected, 2 females tested positive.
The recovery to death ratio showed that for every 46 recoveries, 1 person lost their life.
The mortality rate showed a 2% chance of death for every positive case
The recovery rate showed a 84% recovery for a positive case.
The infection rate in a given sample size showed 81 positive cases for every 1000 people tasted.


**RECOMMENDATIONS**

From our research we realized that covid is more rampant in the metropolitan area consisting of Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos and Nakuru counties. More policies should be set up in order to curb its spread to other counties. In addition, the current positive percentage rate in Kenya stands at 8%; 1 in 13 people have COVID-19 as it stands. For this reason it is important for everyone to practice respiratory hygiene such as coughing into a flexed elbow, practicing social distance, washing hands with alcohol based sanitizers and wearing a mask in order to curb the COVID-19 virus.
